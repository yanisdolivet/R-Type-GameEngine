# R-Type Game Engine

A modular, cross-platform 2D game engine developed in C++20 using a custom Entity Component System (ECS) architecture. This engine was built specifically to support the development of an R-Type game implementation, featuring a decoupled rendering backend and an event-driven design.

## Technical Overview

This project implements a custom ECS kernel from scratch, prioritizing cache locality and composition over inheritance.

### Core Architecture

* **ECS Kernel**: The core utilizes **Sparse Arrays** for efficient component storage and retrieval. It employs a **Zipper Iterator** pattern to allow iterating over multiple component arrays simultaneously, ensuring that systems only process entities possessing all required components.
* **Event System**: A publish-subscribe event bus handles communication between systems (e.g., collisions, input events) without tight coupling.
* **Rendering Abstraction**: The engine uses an interface-based design (`IRender`) to decouple game logic from the graphics library. The current implementation uses **Raylib**.
* **Systems**:
* **Physics & Collision**: AABB collision detection and velocity-based movement integration.
* **Animation**: Dynamic sprite animation system supporting frame management and state switching.
* **Input**: Event-based input handling supporting key mapping and release triggers.



### Tech Stack

* **Language**: C++20
* **Build System**: CMake
* **Package Manager**: Conan
* **Dependencies**: Raylib, spdlog, GTest

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your development machine:

* C++ Compiler supporting C++20 (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
* CMake (3.28+)
* Conan (2.0+)
* Python 3

### Installation and Build

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd R-Type-GameEngine

```


2. **Install dependencies with Conan:**
This project uses Conan to manage dependencies. Generate the build files and CMake presets.
```bash
conan profile detect --force
conan install . --build=missing

```


3. **Configure the project:**
Use the CMake preset generated by Conan (e.g., `conan-release` or `conan-debug`).
```bash
cmake --preset conan-release

```


4. **Build:**
```bash
cmake --build --preset conan-release

```



## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

The project adheres to a strict C++20 coding standard enforced by **Clang-Format** and **Clang-Tidy**.

* **Formatting**: LLVM style with 4-space indentation.
* **Linting**: The CI pipeline enforces checks on all pull requests. You can run the formatter locally using the provided CMake target:
```bash
cmake --build build --target format

```
